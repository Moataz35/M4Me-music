## M4Me-music

A simple application to play audio files.

## About this project

### Built with

* C++
* Raylib
* tinyfiledialogs

## Usage

You just have 2 buttons in the application `Change Song` to choose a song to play and the play/pause button.

## Future updates

* Add buttons for moving forward and backward 10 seconds.

* I will add a feature to add a playlist of songs to play any song from it without the need of choosing a song from your local every time.
