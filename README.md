## M4Me-music

A simple application to play audio files.

## About this project

### Built with

* C++
* Raylib
* tinyfiledialogs

## Usage

You have 3 buttons in the application.
 `Change Song` to choose a song to play.
 `play/pause` button to play and pause the song.
`volume button` to show a slider to change the volume.

## Future updates

* Add buttons for moving forward and backward 10 seconds.

* I will add a feature to add a playlist of songs to play any song from it without the need of choosing a song from your local every time.
